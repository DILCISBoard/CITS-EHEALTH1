# Standards
Controlled vocabularies and coding provide a standardised way for the unambiguous recording of health data. Most EMR and all EHR systems will hold coded data concerning Patient Cases that can be extracted as metadata for the Patient Medical Record and will use international standard vocabularies and  encodings such as ICD or SNOMED. Metadata can be recorded in a number of standardised (such as HL7 FHIR) formats or to a local format which is specified by the health archive and referenced within a Submission Agreement. Background information on eHealth standards such as FHIR, ICD and SNOMED is given in the Guideline.
