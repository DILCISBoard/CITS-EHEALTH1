# 5 Standards
Controlled vocabularies and coding provide a standardised way for the unambiguous recording of health data. Most EMR and all EHR systems will hold coded data concerning Patient Cases that can be extracted as metadata for the Patient Medical Record and will use international standard vocabularies such as ICD or SNOMED. Data can be recorded in standardised (such as ISO 13606 or FHIR) formats or to a local format which is specified by the health archive and referenced within a Submission Agreement. Background information on eHealth standards such as ISO 13606, FHIR, ICD and SNOMED is given in the Guideline.
