# Principles
1. Principle 1– use of existing standards
Wherever possible the eHealth1 specification encourages the use of existing international specifications for patient administrative, clinical, diagnostics, medication information and vocabularies for diseases, conditions and treatments.
2. Principle 2 – the Complete Patient Medical Record and Patient centricity
CITS eHealth1 supports the creation of a centralised (national or regional) health archive of Complete Patient Medical Records, where the intention is to make data available to next of kin and should contain as much of the original data from source systems as possible. Data is organised to be patient centric and so access to a complete record from multiple submissions is possible.
3. Principle 3 – ability to create cohorts for research purposes
CITS eHealth1 supports the creation of a centralised (national or regional) health archive of Complete Patient Medical Records, where the intention is to make data available to researchers and should allow the creation of search databases and indexes based on key patient demographic and clinical data.
4. Principle 4 – support for born digital and digitised records
The specifaction allows for data submitted by producers (or generated at the archive) to be extractions from Electronic Record Management (EMR) or Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems or to be data generated through digitisation of physical records.
5. Principle 5 – bulk submission of Patient records from producers
Based on the principals above, the intellectual content of archival information packages (AIPs) in a health archive will most likely be limited to data about a single Patient. However, the specification recognises that submissions are likely to be made from healthcare providers on a batch basis on a regular schedule and the submission format should allow inclusion of multiple Patient records. Processes at the archive can then parse submission collections into individual patient SIPs and ingest into the archive such as to create individual patient AIPs.
