CITS EHEALTH1
=============
## E-ARK Content Information Type Specification for Patient Medical Records

The eHealth1 specification is built upon work done by the Directorate for Health in Norway on the establishment of a standard for electronically extracting health records from healthcare provider Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems and their submission to a central health archive. The use cases envisaged for the central health archive are: a. to provide records to next of kin in compliance with open information regulation and b. to harvest the vast amount of historical healthcare-related data for medical research. The CITS takes input from the Norwegian specification on the structure of extractions from submitting systems and puts this into a framework that is compliant with the EARK common and package specifications. The eHealth1 specification also recommends the use of international domain standards for descriptive metadata. The specification is accompanied by two METS profiles for the Root and Representations within the packages.

## Guideline (Primer) for CITS eHealth1
This guideline (primer) describes the eHealth1 s Content Information Type Specification (CITS). Some notes regarding the scope of  implementation are included, but in most cases, this will not be sufficient to explain how the specification will actually be applied, due to the complexity of each system. The guideline will be an evolving document, and thoroughly explained examples will be added continuously.
